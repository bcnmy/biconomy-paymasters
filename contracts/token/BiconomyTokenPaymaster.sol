// Biconomy Token Paymaster
/**
 * A token-based paymaster that allows user to pay gas fee in ERC20 tokens. The paymaster owner chooses which tokens to accept.
 * The payment manager (usually the owner) first deposits native gas into the EntryPoint. Then, for each transaction, it takes the gas fee from the user's ERC20 token balance.
 * The manager must convert these collected tokens back to native gas and deposit it into the EntryPoint to keep the system running.
 * It is an extension of VerifyingPaymaster which trusts external signer to authorize the transaction, but also with an ability to withdraw tokens.
 *
 * The validatePaymasterUserOp function does not interact with external contracts but uses an externally provided exchange rate.
 * Based on the exchangeRate and requiredPrefund amount, the validation method checks if the user's account has enough token balance. This is done by only looking at the referenced storage.
 * All Withdrawn tokens are sent to a dynamic fee receiver address.
 *
 * Optionally a safe guard deposit may be used in future versions.
